# Infinite Scrolling with Intersection Observer

## Overview

This repository serves as a demonstration of implementing the Intersection Observer API to achieve an infinite scrolling effect on a web page. The Intersection Observer is a powerful tool for efficiently handling scroll-based interactions by notifying when a target element enters or exits the viewport.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: Dynamically loads additional content as the user scrolls down the page.
- **Intersection Observer**: Utilizes the Intersection Observer API to efficiently detect the visibility of elements in the viewport.
- **Modular and Customizable**: Easily integrate the provided code into your projects or customize it based on your specific needs.

## Getting Started

- ### Clone the repository:
- ### Open index.html in your preferred web browser.
- ### Scroll down to experience the infinite scrolling effect.

## Usage
Feel free to incorporate the Intersection Observer logic into your own projects. You can customize the threshold, handle loading additional content, and adapt the code to fit your specific requirements.

## Dependencies
No external libraries or dependencies are required for this demo. The Intersection Observer is natively supported in modern web browsers.
